    Behavioral analytics functions for DuckDB, providing complete ClickHouse parity:

    - **sessionize**: Window function assigning session IDs based on timestamp gaps
    - **retention**: Cohort retention analysis returning boolean arrays
    - **window_funnel**: Conversion funnel step tracking with 6 composable modes
    - **sequence_match**: Pattern matching over event sequences (NFA-based)
    - **sequence_count**: Count non-overlapping pattern matches
    - **sequence_match_events**: Return matched condition timestamps
    - **sequence_next_node**: Find the next event value after a pattern match

    All functions support up to 32 boolean event conditions. Pure Rust implementation
    with zero unsafe code in business logic. Benchmarked at 824 Melem/s (sessionize)
    and 92 Melem/s (sequence_match) on commodity hardware.
